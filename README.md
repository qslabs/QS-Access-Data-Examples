## QS-Access-Data-Examples
If you don't have any HealthKit data to work with, or just want to play with some example data we've created a few files that you can use as examples. Download the included files to get a sense of how QS Access data tables are formatted. 


## Hourly vs Daily Data
Each time you create a table, you can chose to work with either hourly or daily values. QS Access does some processing to HealthKit data so that it can be accessed in convenient “chunks” for analysis. These won't be appropriate for all uses, but many interesting questions can be asked of data that is presented as a time series using hourly and/or daily values.
